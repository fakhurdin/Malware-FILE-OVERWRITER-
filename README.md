# File Overwriter Virus

This script presents a simple file overwriting virus written in batch script. When executed, it prompts the user whether to proceed or not. If the user chooses to proceed, it searches for all `.txt` files in the `IMPORTANT` directory and its subdirectories. For each `.txt` file found, it overwrites the contents with a predefined message. Additionally, it copies itself to the directory of the infected file, potentially spreading the virus. The script terminates with a confirmation message or an abort message depending on the user's choice.

## Usage
1. Run the script.
2. Choose whether to proceed or not.
3. If proceeding, the script searches for `.txt` files and overwrites them.
4. Confirmation or abort message is displayed at the end.
